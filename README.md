# SVG-Logo-Maker

# Description 
This application allows users to generate their own logo using inquirer to prompt questions in the command line to determine what the logo will look like. As of now it allows for three shapes, circle, square, and triangle, what color you want the text and the chosen shape to be, and includes a test suite using jest. After all questions have been answered the application will generate an SVG file where the user can view their new logo.
